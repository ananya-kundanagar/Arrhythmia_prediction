<b><i>Arrhythmia_prediction</b></i>
<br>
<p>In this project machine learning algorithm is used to detect arrythmia heart disease using ECG database, ECG monitors the heart beat of person and with that we could predict whether the person has irregular heart beat and suffers from arrythmia or not. 
 Using this data, built a model which gets trained and tried to predict whether a new out of sample data has a probability of having arrythmia or not.In the validation set of the data it's not only the accuracy that the model has to take care rather the true positive rate and true negative rate</p>
 
 <br>
 <p>In this project ECG dataset as the original datset which contains attributes like age, sex, height, QRS and PRS interval. The data is processed and clean the data, replaced missing values with median and dropped unimportant attributes. Then split the dataset in train and test dataset in 70- 30 manner. Then apply 4 different classification algorithms to get highest accuracy among them, Random forest gives the highest accuracy so this system used this algorithm to predict the result and display the results in a confusion matrix.</p>
